# Snake Game Javascript

I try to create a snake game with typescript

# Todo
- show score and highscore
- add restart button instead of refresh the whole page
- add menu to adjust size, color and speed for snake
- add menu to adjust size and color for food
- add menu to adjust canvas size and color
- customization game over if the snake is eating itself
