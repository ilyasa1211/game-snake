I try to create a snake game with typescript

# Todo
- food should not spawn inside the snake body
- show score and highscore
- add restart button instead of refresh the whole page
- add menu to custom size, color and speed for snake
- add menu to custom size and color for food
- add menu to custom canvas size and color
- add game over if the snake is eating itself, can be customized
